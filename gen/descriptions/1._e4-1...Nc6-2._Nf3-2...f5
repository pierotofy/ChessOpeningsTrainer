<p>If accepted, it is generally safer for White to give back the pawn through 3. exf5 d5 4.d4 Bxf5, with a fairly equal position, but White can also hold onto the pawn with 4. Bd3, but this is less accurate. One of White's more powerful weapons against the Colorado Countergambit is 4. Bb5 Bxf5 5.Ne5, as White's pieces are getting a lot of action.
