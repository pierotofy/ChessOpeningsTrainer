<p>This riposte from White is more dangerous than it looks. The possible sacrifice on f7 can be deadly if Black dares to take the offered pawn (2...Nxe4).
</p><p>Is Black wants to avoid this, he may try to get the bishop out of c4 with 2...b5. If White takes the pawn, Black can take the e4 pawn and he would have exchanged a wing pawn against a central pawn!
</p><p>Other options include 2...e6 and 2...d5.
</p><p>To get back into more peaceful lines, Black can transpose to the Bishop's Opening with e5.
