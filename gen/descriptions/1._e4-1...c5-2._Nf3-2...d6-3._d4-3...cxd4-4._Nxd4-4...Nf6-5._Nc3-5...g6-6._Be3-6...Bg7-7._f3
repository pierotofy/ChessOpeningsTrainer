<p>7. f3 is known as the Yugoslav attack. The f3-pawn defends White's only center pawn at e4, freeing up her c3-knight. It also sets up a possible rook lift to the 2nd rank on the f-file following a kingside castling. Though 7. f3 blocks the diagonal kingside mobility of White's queen, the queen can occupy a powerful central seat with 8. Qd2, where she can participate in either a queenside or kingside attack. For more on this, see Boleslavsky-Lissitzin (Moscow, 1956).
