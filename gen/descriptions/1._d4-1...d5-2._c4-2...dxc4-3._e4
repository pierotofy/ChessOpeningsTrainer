<p>In this line, white moves immediately to reclaim the "gambit" pawn. The rationale is simple. In most lines of the QGA, white allows black to play ...Nf6 which usually means white has to play f2-f3 in preparation for e3-e4. By playing e2-e4 now, white establishes broad control of the center without losing time. This also has the potential advantage of allowing the c1-bishop to develop unhindered. Also, black is forced to choose a central strategy now or else face being dominated by white's center and development. Black is no worse in these lines, though, than in the classical QGA's, and can obtain counterplay in these lines as well as the others. Here are several options:
</p>
<ul><li>3...e5</li>
<li>3...c5</li>
<li>3...Nf6 - Playing this now can lead to Alekhine-like positions.</li>
<li>3...Nc6 - Takes advantage of the fact white has not played 3. Nf3 to pressurize the d4 pawn.</li></ul><p>Trying to hold on to the pawn with 3...b5?! is not advised, as even though the e4 pawn blocks the h1-a8 diagonal, it is still quite risky to hold on to the pawn. After 4. a4! c6 5. axb5 cxb5, the weak diagonal is subject to discovered attacks and queen-bishop batteries. The b5 pawn could soon be in jeopardy and white's attacking opportunities and moderate (but still significant) lead in development gives more than enough compensation for the pawn.
