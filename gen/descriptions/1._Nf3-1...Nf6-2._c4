<p>2. c4 is a very common move in the English Opening, competing for the d5 square. It is also very flexible, allowing white to transpose into Queen's Pawn openings with a later d4 move or various lines in the English Opening (1.c4).
</p><p>This position is also often reached with the move order 1.c4 Nf6 2.Nf3.
