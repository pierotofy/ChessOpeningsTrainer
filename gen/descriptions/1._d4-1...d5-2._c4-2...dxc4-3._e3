<h3><span id="3._e3">3. e3</span></h3>
<p>This move is not quite so popular as the main lines 3. e4 or 3. Nf3, but respectable nonetheless. It is a more conservative move. White opts to defend d4 instead of taking the center with pawns. Black cannot try to hold on to his c-pawn because of the famous trap 3...b5? (black should pursue development with ...e5) 4. a4! (getting the base of the pawn chain) c6? (further weakening the h1 to a8 diagonal) 5. axb5! cxb5?? (it would still be better to develop now, even though white will end with a pawn up or a huge lead in development) 6. Qf3! when Black must part with at least a minor piece because the weak h1 to a8 diagonal can't be defended anymore. Note: 6... Bb7 loses to 7. Qxb7. 
</p><p>Common Black continuations include:
</p>
<ul><li>3... e5 - a newer, aggressive move that tries to open up the position and likely results in an isolated queen pawn for white (4. dxe5? fails to 4...Qxd1! when white loses castling rights).</li>
<li>3... e6 - The more classical, conservative approach, although it results in limited mobility for the light-squared bishop.</li>
<li>3... Nf6 - Typical developing move. White then usually takes the c-pawn.</li></ul>
