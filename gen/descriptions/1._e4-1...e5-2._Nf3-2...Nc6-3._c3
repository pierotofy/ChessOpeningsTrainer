<h3><span id="3._c3">3. c3</span></h3>
<p>The Ponziani is one of the oldest openings. Its plan is to support a later d4, and set several traps for unwitting opponents, but it doesn't pose much of a problem for the defence if black knows the lines. An opening that has never been popular. Black can counter with the immediate d5.
</p><p>Some evaluations:
</p><p>The defense 3. ...Nf6 often leads to a game where White has a small space advantage plus a small time advantage. Not really a bad deal at all. This defense, however, is rather quiet and drawish.
</p><p>The defense 3. ... d5 leads to a good fight for both sides but really the person who knows current theory best will probably get a very good game.
</p><p>The defense 3. ... f5 fairly often leads to a White advantage but again theory must be known.
</p><p>The defense 3. ... d6 will usually lead to a positions often reached via the Ruy Lopez, Steinitz Variation [usually just fine for White]
</p><p>There are "refutations" to the Ponziani in two books  The Kaufman Repertoire for Black and White and The open Games for Black.
