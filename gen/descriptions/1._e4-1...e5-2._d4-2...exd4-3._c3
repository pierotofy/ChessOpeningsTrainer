<p>White chooses to play an aggressive game. By giving a two-pawn material advantage to his opponent, Black spends two moves to capture both of the pawns, and has to deal with a massive attack. Black has few choices here:
</p>
<ul><li>The most common move for Black to play here is to take the pawn, 3...dxc3.</li>
<li>However, another common alternative is to safely decline the gambit and play 3...d5 or 3...d6.</li></ul>
