</p><p>This used to be the main line, mostly out of Fischer's theoretical work. Today it is considered the sharpest line, with sacrifices on d5, b2, g7, and f7, and other such things. Mostly it is because of the large mass of variations that stem from this position. Today, however, the variation has rather fallen out of favor due to the increasing popularity of the Poisoned Pawn Variation after 7...Qb6.
