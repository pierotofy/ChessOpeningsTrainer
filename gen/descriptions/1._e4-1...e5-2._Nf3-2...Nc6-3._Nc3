<p>Black can copy White's moves with 3...Nf6, leading to a very quiet game.
</p><p>Other alternatives include bishop movesÂ :
</p>
<dl><dd>3...Bb4 is playable, but maybe too early because White can play 4. Nd5 (the knight is not pinned yet).</dd>
<dd>3...Bc5 is dangerous because White can take the e5 pawn and grab back material with the d4 fork. But it's not really a mistake because Black will be able to take a pawn during the process. In this line, Bxf2+ is playable and does not lose material.</dd></dl><p>It's also possible to play 3...g6. It may prepare f5. It may also transpose into Scotch Game as the d4 counter-attack is often seen.
