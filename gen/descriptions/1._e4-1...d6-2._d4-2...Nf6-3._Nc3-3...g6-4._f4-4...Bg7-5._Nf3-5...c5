<p>Black strikes at the center before White can make a move with it. His move may seem antipositional, as after 6.dxc5 dxc5 7.Qxd8+ Kxd8 8.Be3 b6 9.0-0-0+ Bd7 gives White an excellent game, due to Black's uncastled king and poor pawn position. However, Black can get a favorable pawn structure by using a tactical trick. The reason for the variation's nickname is for the excellent pawn structure that Black can get out of it, the Sicilian Dragon.
