<p>The <b>Corn Stalk Defence</b>, also known as the <b>Ware Defense</b> or <b>Corn Stalks</b>, is a rare chess opening with the moves:
</p>
<dl><dd>1. e4 a5</dd></dl><p>It is generally regarded as a dubious response to 1. e4, as it does nothing to aid in Black's development, allows White a free hand in the center, and weakens the b5 and b6 squares. Note the Rook development to a6 is already prevented. However, if played in a style similar to 1...a6, namely with Black playing 2...b6 and 3...Bb7, it can be effective. Preston Ware, someone known for playing eccentric openings, often used the Corn Stalk Defence in tournament play, with decent success.
