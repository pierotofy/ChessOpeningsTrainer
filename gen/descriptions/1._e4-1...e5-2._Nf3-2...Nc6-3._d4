<p>This aggressive move practically forces Black to play 3...exd4 which releases central tension very early. This should lead to a very open game with a lot of space for both players.
</p><p>A few tries have been made with 3...d6 but this move is considered inferior because of 4.dxe5 dxe5 5.Qxd8+ Kxd8 6.Bc4.
</p><p>3...Nxd4 is playable: 4.Nxd4 exd4 5.Qxd4 and some good players believe that black nearly equalizes in this line.
</p><p>Also seen after 3...Nxd4 is 4. Nxe5, after which black will have to move the knight.
