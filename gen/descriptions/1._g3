<p>Also known as the <b>King's Fianchetto Opening</b>, with this move, White prepares to fianchetto the Bishop to g2. It has many long term prospects of applying pressure on the centre and Black's Queenside. The ease with which White can castle Kingside often aids White's position. When playing this opening, White will often adopt the Barcza System, with a Bishop on g2 and a Knight on f3.  Black can mirror White's fianchetto, thus entering the hypermodern Fianghetto.
