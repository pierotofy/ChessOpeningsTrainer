<p>The natural 6. Re1 is in fact a very minor sideline; not only does it commit the rook to the e-file unnecessarily, but it allows Black's knight to retreat to c5, forcing the exchange of the a4-bishop. If Bxc6 dxc6, Black is then doing rather well compared to the Exchange Variation as the bishop has lost a tempo and the disappearance of the centre pawns favours Black's bishop pair.
</p><p>The immediate attempt to grab the pawn back with 6. Bxc6 and 7. Nxe5 is similar but even kinder to Black; it gives her a knight on e5 to gang up on.
</p><p>Instead, White should control c5 with 6. d4 which tends to be a good developing move anyway. This threatens Black's e-pawn again, while the complications resulting from 6...exd4 are not considered too much to handle.
