<p>This Bishop has not really any sense on the Square b5, when there is no knight on c6. It can be easily attacked by the c pawn (c6). Other moves can end in a ruy lopez/spanish situation (like Nc6 3.Nf3) or other Situations, were black should be fine. Back to 2. c6, the bishop can move to f1 (wich made white just waste 2 tempi), c4 (wich allows d5 come with tempo and gives black a classical center), d3 and e2 (wich allows one as well) and a4 (allowing 3. b5 4.ba4b3 d5 and black has a classical center. Engines may preffer 3. Nf6) On move 2 Black can also play Nf6, develop normal and make use of the bishop on b5 later.
</p><p><i><u>Maybe</u> this is an opening, hoping that black attacks the bishop too much and weakens it's dark squares, or overextends.</i>
