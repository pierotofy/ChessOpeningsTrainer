<p>White may take the pawn with 3.Nxe5 because retaking with 3... fxe5 would result in either the loss of a rook after 4. Qh5+ g6 5. Qxe5+ Qe7 6. Qxh8 or an irresistible attack after 4... Ke7 5.Qxe5+ Kf7 6. Bc4+ (the rest of White's pieces come out with gain of time) d5! (best. If simply 6... Kg6 7. Qf5+ Kh6 8. d4+ g5 9. h4 Black is getting mated) 7. Bxd5+ Kg6 8. Bxb7! again winning a rook because if 8... Bxb7 then 9. Qf5+, with a similar line as to above.
</p><p>The only chance for Black after 3. Nxe5 that does not lose immediately is 3... Qe7, but White has a large advantage after 4. Nf3 Qxe4+ 5. Be2 because of their large lead in development.
