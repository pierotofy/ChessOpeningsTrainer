<h1><span id="Sicilian_-_Taimanov">Sicilian - Taimanov</span></h1>
<p>This is the initial position at the start of the Taimanov or Taimanov system, developed by Russian GM Mark Taimanov. It can be thought of as a mirror to the position leading to most variations such as the Dragon, with the c6 knight developed rather than the f6 one and the e6 pawn developed rather than the d6 one.
