<p>The logical continuation is 6...Bg7.
</p><p>Black might be tempted to play the trap 6...Ng4??, intending to chop off White's dark-squared Bishop, which would strengthen the Black Bishop soon arriving at g7. But this is a beginner's mistake, it loses horribly to 7.Bb5+:
</p>
<ul><li>7...Nd7 8.Qxg4 wins a Knight</li>
<li>7...Bd7 8.Qxg4 also wins the Knight, since the Bishop on d7 is pinned</li>
<li>7...Nc6 8.Nxc6 bxc6 9.Bxc6+, forking the King and Rook and winning the exchange and a pawn.</li></ul>
<p>1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 g6 6.Be3
