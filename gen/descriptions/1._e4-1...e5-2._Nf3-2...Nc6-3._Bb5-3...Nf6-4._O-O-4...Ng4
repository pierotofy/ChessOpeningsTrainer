<h3><span id="4._Ng4">4. Ng4</span></h3>
<p>With 4...Ng4 black sets up the Fishing Pole Trap. While the logical move seems to be h3, to kick the knight off of his spot, this in fact sets up for immediate failure.
</p><p>After 5.h3, black responds with 5...h5. After 6.hxg4 hxg4, black then threatens to capture the f3 knight. Once white moves the knight away, black forces checkmate by Qh4.
