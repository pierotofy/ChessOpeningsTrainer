<h3><span id="2...e6">2...e6</span></h3>
<p>With 2...e6, Black declines the Queen's Gambit in the traditional fashion. 2...e6 bolsters the d5 pawn and opens a diagonal for the development of Black's dark-squared bishop. However, 2...e6 also blocks the c8-h3 diagonal for Black's light-squared bishop. Finding a way to productively develop this piece is a perennial challenge for Black players in the QGD.
