<h3><span id="2._Qh5">2. Qh5</span></h3>
<p>This move violates one of the main principles in chess by developing the queen too early. As the e5 pawn is under attack, Black normally defends it with 2...Nc6, though he may offer it as a gambit in order to obtain a lead in development with 2...Nf6!?
</p><p>Note that this position allows one of the quickest possible mates for White if Black plays 2...Ke7 (3. Qxe5#).
