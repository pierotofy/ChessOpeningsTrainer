<p>The advance variation was widely regarded as inferior for many years, owing chiefly to the strategic demolition that Aron Nimzowitsch (playing as White) suffered at the hands of José Capablanca in one of their games at the New York 1927 tournament:
</p><p>Black almost always plays 3...Bf5 to free the light-squared bishop outside the pawn chain, but, when trying to avoid the weight of theory associated with this line, can play 3...c5.
</p><p>The Advance Variation has since been revitalized by aggressive lines such as the Bayonet Attack (4.Nc3 e6 5.g4) favored by Latvian Grandmaster Alexei Shirov or the less ambitious variation 4.Nf3 e6 5.Be2 c5 6.Be3 popularized by English Grandmaster Nigel Short.
</p>
<p>The 3...c5 variation is an important alternative and avoids the weight of theory associated with 3...Bf5. It was used by Mikhail Botvinnik in his 1961 match vs. Mikhail Tal (though with a negative outcome for Botvinnik – two draws and a loss). In comparison to the French defense, Black lacks the tempo normally spent on ...e6. However, White can only exploit this by the weakening of his own central bind with 4. dxc5 when Black has good chances of regaining the pawn.
