<p>This is the main line of the Winawer Variation. Black's bishop is pinning white's c knight, and his c5 advance has just put additional pressure on white's center. At this point, white has chosen to regain the initiative by kicking out the bishop with 5.a3.
</p><p>Black usually takes the knight with 5...Bxc3+, because moving 5...Ba5 leaves the c5 pawn undefended and open to white's 6.dxc5.
