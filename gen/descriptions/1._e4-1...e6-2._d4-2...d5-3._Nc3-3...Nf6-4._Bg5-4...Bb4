<p>The McCutcheon variation first became well-known as the result of an 1885 simultaneous exhibition game played in New York by World Champion Steinitz as White against John Lindsay McCutcheon, a lawyer from Pennsylvania.  McCutcheon won convincingly in just 28 moves, and thus brought attention to the variation.  It is still (2013) considered to be a completely sound defense for Black.  There is no record of a previous game with this variation, so it is possible (though impossible to prove) that McCutcheon created a true novelty.
