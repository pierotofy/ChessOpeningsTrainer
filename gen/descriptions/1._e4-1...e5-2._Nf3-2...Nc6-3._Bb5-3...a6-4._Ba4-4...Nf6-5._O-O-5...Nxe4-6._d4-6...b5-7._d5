<p>Black has no need to tie herself in knots by moving the knight. After 7...bxa4 8. dxc6 d6, forget about Black's potentially slightly rubbish rook pawns, one of which is an extra pawn anyway - Black has a stable centre with the base of her pawn-chain shielded by White's own pawn, a half-open b-file, a kingside pawn majority that could quite easily wallop White after ...f5 and ...Nf6 and the bishop pair - it's one of those rare positions that are just really good fun.
