<p>This move is a weak opening because it develops the queen too early and subjects it to attack, and deprives the knight of its best square.
</p><p>As with the similar 2. Qh5, White hopes for the scholar's mate: 2.Qf3 Nc6 3.Bc4 Bc5?? 4.Qxf7#.  In both cases, Black can easily avoid the trap. However, the Parham Attack is more forcing and strongerâ€”first requiring Black to defend his e-pawn (usually with 2...Nc6), then after 3.Bc4 forcing Black to play a sub-optimal move (3...g6 virtually committing Black to a fianchetto rather than a more aggressive placement of the bishop; 3...Qe7 blocking the bishop; or 3...Qf6 taking away the knight's best square). 2.Qf3 places no such impediments on Black's development.
