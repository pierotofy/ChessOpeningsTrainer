<h2><span id="1._a4_-_Ware_Opening">1. a4 - Ware Opening</span></h2>
<p>The Ware Opening attacks the b5 square and threatens to bring the a1 Rook to the game. However, the b5 square is non-essential and if Black plays 1... e5, the f8 Bishop prevents developing the White Rook for the moment. The reply 1... e5 also gains space for Black in the center, something that openings should do but the Ware Opening does not do.

<p>This opening has no statistics as it almost never occurs among serious chess players and is a fundamentally unsound opening.
