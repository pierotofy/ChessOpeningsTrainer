<p>This is the main line of the Winawer Variation. Black has just pushed forward his c pawn with 4...c5, threatening white's pawn chain. White's knight on c3 prevents him from extending the chain by moving a pawn to c3, so this puts white's center pawns in danger.
</p><p>However, c5 also blocks the escape route for black's dark squared bishop. White usually takes advantage of this to regain the initiative with 5.a3. Black usually trades bishop for knight with 5...Bxc3+ 6.bxc3.
