<p>This is a way for White to avoid the "classical" French Defence. Though White's game looks less active (White will have to fianchetto his king's bishop, leaving time for Black to develop), a powerful attack is possible by advancing king's pawn to e5, building a strong outpost. Like in a sicilian defence, White will launch a king-side attack, and Black can counter-attack at the queen side.
</p><p>The main continuation is d5, though c5 is also correct (many transpositions exist in the King's Indian).
