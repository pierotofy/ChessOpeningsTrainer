<h1><span id="Center_Game">Center Game</span></h1>
<p>In the Center Game, White is happy with himself for knocking out Black's only foothold in the center square, e5.  At the time, all four central squares are controlled by White.  This may seem like a huge advantage for White, but if Black simply plays Nc6, the queen is forced to move.
</p><p>Usually, Black responds to the center game by playing 3...Nc6, forcing White's queen to leave its central outpost.
