<p>White recovers the pawn and has threatened much of Black's space with the Knight. Black can try to force the White Knight away with 4...Nc6, which White can defend by moving pieces in to defend his Knight, or 4...c5, which White would need to counter by moving his Knight or creating a sufficient threat elsewhere to save it.
