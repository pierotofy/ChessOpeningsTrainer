<p>White is now down a pawn. Black has given up most of his center control to White's pawn and Knight. White's best move would be to take the undefended pawn. If the pawn is left there, Black's next move will be to strengthen it and it will become a thorn in White's side. Although 4. Nxd4 seems logical, 4. Qxd4 is also an interesting option.
