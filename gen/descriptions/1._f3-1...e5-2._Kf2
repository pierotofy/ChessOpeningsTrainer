The move <b>2.Kf2</b>?! (ECO code A00)is called various things in various parts of the world. Most commonly known as the <i>Fried Fox/Pork Chop Opening</i> but also known throughout much of Europe as the <i>Hammerschlag</i>.In the United States some theory has been published to award-winning praise under the name <i>Schmoe Attack</i>.[1]
</p><p>In 2001 a "mystery GM" playing at the I.C.C.(Internet Chess Club) was beating all Grand Masters (GMs) and International Masters (IMs) with this opening for several months. GM Nigel Short lost several games to this mystery player using the <i>Pork Chop Opening</i>, and he had a theory from chats he and this player had had after their games that this was in fact Bobby Fischer, trying to prove that you can win at the highest levels in chess even with random openings and in this way promoting <i>Fischer Random Chess</i>.
</p><p>There is a competing rumor told by GM Larry Evans and others in the chess community that someone using a chess interface engine which plays the moves straight to the game instead of the cumbersome process of transferring moves from the chess engine to the online game was playing a trick on the online chess community. Fischer is not on record as having ever commented on the matter.
</p><p><b>Positional Ideas:</b> White wants to calmly trade off pieces to lessen the chances of a successful attack against his king. As pieces come off the board white's king will be in a good position to control the center and help in a king and pawn ending.
</p><p><b>Psychological Ideas:</b> The shock and awe factor of facing this opening may lead to overconfidence and reckless play from black, in this way the game may reach atypical positions with chances for creative and energetic play.
</p><p><b>Opening Ideas:</b> Controlling the center with f3 and often an early pawn advance to c3. An active king who if handled properly can assist in both attack and defense in the late opening and early middle-game.
