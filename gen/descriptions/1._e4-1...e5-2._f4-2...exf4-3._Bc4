<h3><span id="3.Bc4">3.Bc4</span></h3>
<p>With this move, white develops the bishop. This move, common in the nineteenth century, is now less popular than 3. Nf3. Black has an opportunity to prevent white from castling with 3...Qh4+, but in exchange places his queen on a poor square. Alternatively, the second player can develop a piece with 3...Nf6 or play aggressively in the center and give up a pawn with 3...d5 for open lines.
