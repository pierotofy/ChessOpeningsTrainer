<h1><span id="Budapest_Gambit">Budapest Gambit</span></h1>
<p>The move 2...e5 introduces the Budapest Gambit and is an energetic gambit. At first glance it seems to lose a pawn, however the pawn if taken is normally returned so that White avoids tactical issues. The resulting positions can lead to White having a slender advantage of having the bishop pair.
