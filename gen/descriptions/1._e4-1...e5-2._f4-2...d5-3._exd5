<p>This is the normal response, capturing the pawn on d5, as black is putting pressure on both the e4 and f4 pawns of white's and 3. fxe5?? loses to Qh4+!. From here, black has 3 choices:
</p>
<ul><li>3... exf4 is the natural response, where a sample line continues 1. e4 e5 2. f4 d5 3. exd5 exf4 4. Nf3 Nf6 5. c4 c6 6. d4 Bb4+ 7. Nc3 O-O 8. Be2 cxd5 9. O-O Be6 10. Bxf4 dxc4 11. Ng5 Nc6 12. Nxe6 fxe6 13. Bxc4 Qxd4+ 14. Qxd4 Nxd4 15. Rad1 b5 16. Rxd4 bxc4 17. Rxc4, which is equal. There are mutliple ways to diverge from these lines, but all usually lead to equality.</li>
<li>3... c6!? is a new, modern response that focuses on development and the cramping f4 pawn over material. No clear verdict has been reached on this line.</li>
<li>3... e4 used to be considered an option, but now, modern theory gives white a good game after 4. d3, and the line is a very rare sideline these days.</li></ul>
