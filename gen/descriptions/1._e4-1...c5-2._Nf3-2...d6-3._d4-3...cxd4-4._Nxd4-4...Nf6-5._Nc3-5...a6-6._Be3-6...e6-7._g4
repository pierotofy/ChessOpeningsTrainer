<p>The Perenyi Attack is similar in idea to its cousin the Keres Attack of the standard Scheveningen Variation. White mounts an aggressive pawn storm on the kingside, castling long and supporting with Qd2 and Be3. However, it usually arises from a transposition from the Najdorf rather than the normal Scheveningen move order. Compared to the Keres, white has his bishop already developed to the e3 square while black has a pawn on a6 rather than a7.
</p><p>The differences are subtle but critical. Now, the standard line of the Perenyi attack follows with 7...e5. This puts two attackers on the advanced g4 pawn (which only has the queen defending) and threatens the d4 knight. If this were the Keres, white could play Bb5+ Bd7 Bxd7+ Qxd7, which eliminates one attacker on g4. Then Nb3 moves the knight to safety. However, Bb5+ is not an option here because of the a6 pawn.
</p><p>Therefore, play usually continues 8.Nf5 (cutting off the bishop's attack on the g4 pawn and moving the knight away). Black then threatens the knight with 8...g6. At this point, play becomes very complex and sharp. White cannot move the knight away without losing the g4 pawn, and so usually chooses to sacrifice it. White can try to win back a knight with 9.g5 gxf5 10.gxf6, or sacrifice it with 9.g5 gxf5 10.exf5 Ng8 11.f6, boxing in black's kingside pieces. Alternatively, white can develop with 9.Bg2. This leads to a very complex line mostly found in top level chess: 9...gxf5 10.exf5 d5 11.Qe2 d4 12.O-O-O.
