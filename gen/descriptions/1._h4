<h2><span id="1._h4_-_Desprez_Opening">1. h4 - Desprez Opening</span></h2>
<p>The Desprez Opening (or <b>Kádas Opening</b>) is a rather useless move that does nothing to assist the important central squares. No top masters have ever used it in professional play, although some, most notably Hikaru Nakamura, play it during blitz. It could be said that White has made his position worse, as castling Kingside is now less attractive. As a result, this move is rarely seen among serious chess players. However, if you want to throw off your opponent this could be a good starting move.
