<p>Ke2 is considered to be a very dubious move. The problems with 2. Ke2? are that the King move prevents castling to protect the King, endangers the King, ignores development and the center, and blocks the Queen and Bishop, which are the two pieces that are free after 1. e4. All that being said, it can be used as a surprise to unseat Black, as many novices may be unable to cope with the unfamiliar board positions of the Bongcloud Attack. However, if it has been encountered before, it usually results in a defeat for White. This is also called King David's Opening by some.
