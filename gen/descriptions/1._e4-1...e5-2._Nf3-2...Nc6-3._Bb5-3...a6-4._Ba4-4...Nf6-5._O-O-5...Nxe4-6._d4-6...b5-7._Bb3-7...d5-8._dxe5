<p>Black must drop everything and defend the d-pawn from the threat uncovered by dxe5. 8...Be6 does this while also developing and stabilising the centre.
</p><p>For the sake of completeness, 8...Ne7 slows down Blacks development to such an extent that White can give up the bishop pair and still have a commanding position, while the horrible 8...d4 pulls the rug out from under the e4-knight while not particularly improving the pawns condition. Absolutely no Brownie points for either of these moves.
