<h2><span id="4._e4">4. e4</span></h2>
<p>This move controls the center and creates a huge pawn roller. Black's c8-bishop will be blocked and inactive for some time. However, White will have to sac a pawn in a few moves if he wants to fight for the edge. Black didn't move a single piece yet and put all his central pawns on light squares. White quickly got e4 in.
