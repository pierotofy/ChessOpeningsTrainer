<h2><span id="3._Bb5_-_Ruy_Lopez">3. Bb5 - Ruy Lopez</span></h2>
<p>The essential move marking the Ruy Lopez, or Spanish Game. "It is the double king's pawn opening most commonly used in master play; it has been adopted by almost all players at some point in their careers and many play it from both the White and Black sides."
</p><p>White threatens to trade off Black's c6-knight, leaving the e5-pawn undefended. It's not an <i>immediate</i> threat, because after 4. Bxc6 dxc6 5. Nxe5, Black can win the pawn back with 5... Qd4 or 5... Qg5.
</p><p>Black can respond in a variety of ways. The most common move is the Morphy Defence  <b>3... a6</b>. This forces White to make a decision about the Bishop - retreat or exchange.
</p><p>Many other moves are available, some neglecting completely the protection of the knight and the pawn and continuing development.
</p><p>The opening is named after the 16th century Spanish priest Ruy LÃ³pez de Segura.
