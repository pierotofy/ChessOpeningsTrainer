<p>5 ... Nd4 The Fritz Variation of the Two Knights. <br>This move put the Knight in a central position   and can lead to a number of tactical possibilities, however the Knight is always vulnerable to being attacked by a c3 pawn and then having few squares to retreat so the Knight is often exchanged or sacrificed.
