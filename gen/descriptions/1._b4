<h2><span id="1._b4_-_Sokolsky_Opening">1. b4 - Sokolsky Opening</span></h2>
<p>This opening is also known as the "Polish Opening" or "The Orangutan". Some common ideas motivating this move:
</p>
<ul><li>Fianchettoing is often a good idea. Why not grab a little space?</li>
<li>At some point a quick b4-b5 might dislodge a knight on c6.</li>
<li>Trading the b-pawn for the c-pawn may give white central power.</li>
<li>If 1... e5 or 1... e6, usual play either continues with 2. a3 or 2. Bb2. The idea after Bb2 is that the black can't play Bxb4 right away, anyway. E.g., 1. b4 e6 2. Bb2 Bxb4? 3. Bxg7 where black loses material, and 1. b4 e5 2. Bb2 Bxb4!? 3. Bxe5 and black loses a central pawn for a flank pawn.</li></ul><h2><span id="Statistics">Statistics</span></h2>

</p><p>The Big Database has 291 games (out of almost 5.5 million) played with at least one player having a FIDE rating of 2400 or higher. The winning percentages for these games are: White 46%, Drawn 30%, Black 24%.
</p><p>The average FIDE rating of all players is 1926, the average performance rating is 1942 which again compares unfavorably with the average ratings of all players employing 1. d4, 1. Nf3, 1. c4 and the average performance ratings of these openings (both categories are +2200).
</p><p>The average rating of all players employing 1. e4 in the DB is 2135 with an average performance rating of 2161.
</p><p>Few Grandmasters (GMs) employ this opening in serious games. GMs Ivanchuk and Fischer played it three times – in simultaneous exhibitions. GMs Hort, Ljubojevic, Miles, Petrosian and Smyslov played it at least once against fellow GMs or IMs (International Masters); Larsen played it in at least 4 serious games. 
</p><p>Surprisingly, there are a few fairly recent books on this opening. Not surprisingly, none are by GMs (although two are by IMs.)

</p><p>In theory and practice, Black usually responds by playing in the center with 1... d5, or by exploiting the weak position of the pawn by playing 1... e5 or 1... e6. The flexible 1... Nf6 has been played as well.
