<p>White plans to develop his bishop into the long diagonal. By doing this the bishop will exert some serious pressure into the central light squares (especially d5) and into the enemy queenside. This does not come without issues however, as a king castled behind a fianchettoed bishop becomes very vulnerable should the bishop be removed.
Black now has two acceptable options, one is to play d5 immediately as delaying this move will allow white to achieve overprotection of this important central square by 4.Bg2.
Another choice for black, perhaps the sharpest, is to play 3...c6, the knight will be blocked from its best square but black regains control over the d5 square and closes the long diagonal for a bishop on g2. Once d5 has been played by black, his mighty center may cause some problems for white, although (as always) the more developed player can undermine it in hypermodern fashion through the use of his c- pawn, knights and fianchettoed bishop.
