<p>With 4.d3, White plays the Giuoco Pianissimo (Italian: "very quiet game").  White aims for a slow buildup deferring d4 until it can be prepared.  By avoiding an immediate confrontation in the center White prevents the early release of tension through exchanges and enters a positional maneuvering game.  If White plays c2-c3, the position can take some characteristics of the Ruy Lopez if his bishop retreats to c2 via Bc4-b3-c2.  (The alternative move order 4.c3 Nf6 5.d3 is common in master play.)  Despite its drawish reputation, this variation became more popular after being taken up by Anatoly Karpov in the 1978 World Championship<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources">citation needed</span></i>]</sup>.
