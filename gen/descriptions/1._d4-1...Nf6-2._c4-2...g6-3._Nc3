<p>White intends to play e4 with this move. Developing this knight first also keeps options open for being able to play multiple lines against the King's Indian.
</p><p>One of Black's most powerful weapon here is the Gr√ºnfeld Defence with 3...d5. The main variation, 4. cxd5 Nxd5 5. e4 Nxc3 6. bxc3 Bg7 leads to a typical hypermodern situation where White has a powerful center that Black will have to attack from a distance with his dark bishop and a ...c5 pawn break.
</p><p>3...Bg7 and 3...d6 stick to the classical ideas behind the King's Indian, another venerable and popular opening.
