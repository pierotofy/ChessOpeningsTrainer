<p>By moving the queen to a5, she cannot be attacked again, she can pin the knight if White dares to advance his d pawn and she can later move to b6 to target the b2 pawn. This also sets the stage for developing black's pieces while setting up some threats, a much better option than ...Qd8. White's main plans here are Nf3 and d4, continuing to control the center and developing his pieces. Black can give his queen escape squares with a timely ...c6 in case it gets into danger, and can develop his pieces and go for an e7-e5 advance.
