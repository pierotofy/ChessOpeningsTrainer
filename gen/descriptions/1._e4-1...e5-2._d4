<p>This move by White smashes open the center and allows White to develop his pieces with very great speed. Instead of the normal 2...exd4, a countergambit can be tried with 2...f5?!, but this is quite a dubious move and is only reserved for unprepared players. 2...f5 gives white a good game after the threat of Qh5+ can't be stopped (the bishop can move and give a square to the king on f8), as after 3. exf5, Nf6?? loses to e5!, and black has two choices: letting a very dangerous Qh5+ happen or giving up the knight. Once again, unprepared opponents may be surprised by this and play recklessly, leading to possible, but rare wins by black.
