<h2><span id="2._Bc4">2. Bc4</span></h2>
<p>This opening is seldom seen in modern play, although White targets the weak f7 pawn and keeps the possibility of playing a deadly f2-f4. Unlike in 2. Nf3, Black's e5 pawn is not under attack, giving him a wider range of choice. Black's main worry is the Qh5 threat. That's why he shouldn't play Be7 or Ne7.
</p><p>The main choice is 2...Nf6, reacting to White's passivity by attacking the e4 pawn and taking the initiative. Moreover, it prevents Qh5.
</p><p>Black has still the possibility of mirroring White's move with 2...Bc5.
</p><p>2...Nc6 is playable, although a bit passive.
</p><p>The Calabrese Countergambit (2...f5) is very sharp, but may be a deadly weapon if mastered correctly.
</p><p>2...c6, the Philidor Counterattack prepares d5 but is often considered to be too slow.
</p><p>2...d6 may transpose to Philidor's Defence but not necessarily (Black should expect 3. f4).
