<p>White's pawn is now weak. It should be reinforced with other pawns. The most intuitive move is 3. d4. But White can also keep on attacking the knight and play 3. c4 delaying d4. An option may allow White to avoid the sharpest lines of the AlekhineÂ : 3. Nc3. In compensation for doubled pawns, White can accelerate his development.
