<h1><span id="3._d4">3. d4</span></h1>
<p>This is the most popular of white's third move options. It gives back the pawn but occupies the center and attempts to gain time. White often combines this with c2-c4 to gain a space advantage. Black can play 3...Qxd5 which will often transpose to a main line, but more popular choices are 3...Nxd5 and 3...Bg4. The former is the more respected option but black tends to suffer in the resulting cramped positions. This has led to the rise of the Portuguese Variation or Jadoul Gambit with 3...Bg4. This allows white to hold onto the pawn in a few ways but ensures quick development for black and avoids many downfalls of other variations of the Scandinavian.
