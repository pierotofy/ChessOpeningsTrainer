<p>This move places the bishop on a good, active post. However, the drawback is that Nf3 will become unplayable, since Bg4! will put unbearable pressure on d4. It's either Be2/Nf3, Bc4/Ne2 or Bc4/Nf3/h3. In this setup, the bishop will be more active, while in the other setup, the knight will be so. That other setup has increasingly popular since the 1980's.
