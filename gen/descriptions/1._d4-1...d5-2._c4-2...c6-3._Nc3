<p>This move develops a piece and bears more pressure on d5. Due to this, it also makes Bf5 a grave mistake due to cxd5 cxd5 Qb3, winning a pawn. If then Qb6, Nxd5! Qxb3 Nxf6+! wins a pawn. In general, if black can safely play Bf5 and e6 in the Slav, he equalizes. Also, it prepares an e4 advance in the center. However, the knight is vulnerable here to a b7-b5-b4 advance, so ...dxc4 and ...b5 are often played.
