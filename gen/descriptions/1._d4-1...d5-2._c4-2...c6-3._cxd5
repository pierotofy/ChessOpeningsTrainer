<p>After this move, the tension in the center is relieved, often allowing black equality. Because of this, this variation often ends in a draw.
</p><p>Black's only decent move is to complete the exchange of pawns with 3...cxd5, though Nf6!? might be interesting. However, 3...Qxd5? Nc3 gains a lot of tempi on the queen and should be avoided. After the exchange, black will find it difficult to win unless white is overly ambitious.
