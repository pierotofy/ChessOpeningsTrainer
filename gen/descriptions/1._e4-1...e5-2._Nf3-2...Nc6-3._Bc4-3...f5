<dl><dd>Black offers the f pawn.  White's best response is to simply support and develop with 4.d3.  The resulting position is similar to a King's Gambit Declined with Black playing the gambit with less development -- not very comfortable for Black, but White must still play carefully.</dd></dl><dl><dd>Key themes for White at this point are to attack Black's kingside using the light bishop and to resist attempts by black to simplify the position via exchanges.  Exchanges involving White's light bishop are particularly suspect.</dd></dl><dl><dd>The best advice for Black is to not play this gambit as it is considered to be refuted.</dd></dl>
