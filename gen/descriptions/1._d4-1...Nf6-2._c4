<p>2.c4 strengthens White's control of the center, particularly the important d5 square. It also allows White's queenside knight to develop to the active c3 square without blocking the c-pawn.
</p><p>Black has a number of possibilities at this point:
</p>
<ul><li>2...e6 – This move is solid and flexible. Depending on how white plays, black will end up in a Queen's Indian, Nimzo-Indian, Bogo-Indian, Queen's Gambit Declined, Benoni, or a Catalan.</li>
<li>2...g6 – This tends to be more aggressive (and riskier), though still solid if one knows the important strategic points. Black has the choice to move into a King's Indian Defence (KID) (regardless of white's play) or possibly a Grünfeld if white plays 3. Nc3 and black wishes.</li>
<li>2...c5 – This will likely end up being a Benoni (often aggressive, risky), Benko-gambit (positional pawn sacrifice by black on queenside), a symmetrical English (a bit quieter, but active pieces), or even a Tarrasch QGD (active for both sides).</li>
<li>2...d6 – This is the so-called "Old Indian," and it can either transpose into a KID or follow less popular lines with a strategy similar to the KID.</li>
<li>2...e5 – The Budapest Gambit. It has a unique character and often allows black active play. White usually gives the pawn back eventually, and usually gets a slightly better position, but black can do well against the ignorant white player.</li>
<li>2...d5 – The Marshall Defence. This is not the best idea, though not an absolute trap. Several opening encyclopedias give this a clear advantage to white if played right.</li></ul>
