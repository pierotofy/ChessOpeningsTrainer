<p>There's a pawn on g4 if White wants to capture it, but it isn't a free gift: Black is counter-attacking e4.
</p><ul><li><b>6. d4</b> is the main line. White is attacking a pawn and Black is attacking a pawn, that's 1 pawn each, so rather than resolve either of those situations, White makes to 2 to 1 in her favour! This move also ensures that once Black kicks the knight away from e5 by playing ...d6, it will be able to retreat to d3 without blocking the d-pawn. Playing 6.d3 wouldn't have that advantage, and would also shut in the f1-bishop.</li>
<li><b>6. Bc4</b> was the move favoured by the world champion of the pre-World Championship era, Paul Morphy. White capitalises on the e5-knight's attack on f7. Black will have to close the diagonal with 6...d5 7.exd5, after which material will be level but White's bishop will be blockaded by its own pawn.</li>
<li><b>6. Nxg4</b> is also possible, but White is in danger of remaining a pawn down after 6...Nxe4 and will have to enter some complications involving a sacrifice of the rook on h1.</li></ul>
