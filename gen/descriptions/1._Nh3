<h2><span id="1._Nh3_-_Ammonia_Opening">1. Nh3 - Ammonia Opening</span></h2>
<p>The Ammonia opening is based on the chemical formula of ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>) and the fact that ammonia, like this opening, 'stinks'. Other titles for this opening include; the Amar Opening, the Paris Opening, and Drunken Knight Opening. Chess author Tim Harding has jokingly suggested that "Amar" is an acronym for "Absolutely mad and ridiculous"; that sums up this move!
</p><p>It's not bad, it just does not improve White's position, as such it's a wasted opportunity.
