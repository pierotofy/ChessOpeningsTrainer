<p>While White's 3.Nf3 prevented the check on h4, Black's third move renews the threat and develops. Here White doesn't have a promising way to stop the check on h4, as 4.g3?! fxg3 5.hxg3 Nf6 saddles White with a weak isolated pawn on g3, and the semi-open h-file cannot be effectively used. If he tries h4?! Nf6, he creates all sorts of weaknesses down the g-file, and further delays his development. He has two main continuations: 4.Bc4 and 4.Nc3, while d4!?, gaining central space, freeing d2 for the king, and preparing to round up f4 with Bxf4, may be playable as well. 4.Bc4 is the main line, clearing f1 for the White king to move to and eyeing a possible attack on f7. 4.Nc3, however, is also good, with simple development.
