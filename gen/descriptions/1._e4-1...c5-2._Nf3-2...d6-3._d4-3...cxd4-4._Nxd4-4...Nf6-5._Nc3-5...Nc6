<p>Blacks move 5...d6 protects the recently developed knight from being attacked.  A pawn move is thus in order, since both knights are developed to good squares, and the Bishop on c8 now has the option, but not the obligation, to develop to a good square once white makes known his intentions.
</p><p>Of all the responses for white, Bg5 is perhaps the best, and should be expected from a strong opponent.   It pins the king knight, prepares for queenside castling, and it is the prelude to the Richter-Rauzer Attack (named after Vsevolod Alfredovich Rauser).
