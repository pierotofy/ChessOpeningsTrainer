<p>4.O-O is the most common reply to the Berlin Defence. This move protects the king by moving it out of the center. It also brings the rook into the center. If 4...Nxe4 then 5.Re1 and when the knight retreats e5 falls after 6.Nxe5. If black plays 4...Be7 (most common reply), white should also play 5.Re1 as there is no longer a threat on the black king after Rxe5.
