<p>The Symmetrical Variation. Play varies greatly depending on how white chooses to develop, for instance 2.Nf3 signals that white will try to achieve a favourable break with the d-pawn immediately and black can then try to impede this break and achieve his own immediate d-pawn break. 
2.Nc3 on the other hand makes it harder for black to achieve that pawn break and signals whiteÂ´s intention to develop first and then break the symmetry. For instance common moves for white in this variations include g3,Bg2,e4,Nge2, d3 and o-o( the arising white pawn structure is called the Botvinnik system) with the idea of a pawn break on f4, b4 or even d4. White may also play e3 instead of e4 and once the knight gets to e2 the pawn break on d4 becomes a very attractive possibility.
