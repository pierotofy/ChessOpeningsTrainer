<p>White gains some space advantage immediately, and prevents Black from developing their king's knight to its most natural square f6.
</p><p>Because Black's position is somewhat cramped at the moment, he usually decides to undermine White's pawn chain on d4/e5, which
hinders Black from developing the pieces of their kingside to good squares.  This is typically done by attacking the base of White's pawn chain - d4 - by playing 3...c5.
