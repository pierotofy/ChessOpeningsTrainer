<h3><span id="6.Bc4">6.Bc4</span></h3>
<p>6.Bc4 begins the Sozin attack on the classical Sicilian. Black may choose to reply with <b>e6</b>, which is a position easily reached through transposition from the Scheveningen variation as well (6.Bc4,Nc3). However, from the Scheveningen variation white tends to pick other attacks which are more suited to the position, such as the English Attack or the Keres Attack. The Sozin attack is often considered less common and less ambitious than the Richter-Rauzer Attack.
</p><p>Black could also choose to reply with <b>g6</b> transposing to a form of the Dragon variation, but this leads to the "Magnus Smith trap," with a lot of trouble for black (see a YouTube analysis here).
</p><p>If black does play <b>e6</b>, both players typically develop bishops with white playing <b>Be3</b> and black responding with <b>Be7</b>. In this position if white castles king side it is called the <b>Fisher-Sozin</b> attack. If white instead moves Qe2 and eventually castles queenside it is called the <b>Velimirovic</b> variation.
