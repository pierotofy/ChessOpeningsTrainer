<p>A flexible second move by black reaching a Nimzo-Indian or Queen`s Indian defence setup is a possibility for black with good prospects as pinning the white knight at c3 weakens whiteÂ´s grip over the d5 square and threatens doubled pawns, not to mention that since white has not yet moved his d-pawn black might as well get a lead in development.
</p><p>Black should be careful about this move however as white has the option of playing 3.e4 a move that leads to the ultra sharp Mikenas Carls variation where black will require very accurate play in order to stay alive.
</p><p>And last but not least 3.Nf3 will lead to the more tactical lines of the symmetrical English after 3...c5 and a fight over the d4 and d5 squares will develop.
