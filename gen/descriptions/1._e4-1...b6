<p>Black prepares to fianchetto his queenside bishop. This move is not popular at the professional level because it gives white easy development and a full pawn centre, while black himself will be constrained to the last three ranks of the board for some time. Nonetheless, it has occasionally been dabbled with and black can get good counterplay if white is unwise and overextends his pawns in the centre.
