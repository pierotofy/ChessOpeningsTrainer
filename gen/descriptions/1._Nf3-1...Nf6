<h3><span id="1...Nf6">1...Nf6</span></h3>
<p>1...Nf6, keeping the position symmetrical, is the most flexible reply to 1.Nf3. At Grandmaster level this is a very popular move and has been the preferred response of both Anand and Kasparov.
</p><p>From here, the game can go in a number of directions and there are plenty of transpositional possibilities into 1.d4 and 1.c4 openings.
