<h1><span id="Closed_Sicilian">Closed Sicilian</span></h1>
<p>Closed Sicilian is a strategical opening that often leads to a slow white kingside attack. Black usually fights for counterplay on the queenside. Much less played than the main line 2.Nf3, this opening is a good alternative against Sicilian experts.

<p>2...Nc6
</p><p>Most of the time in the Sicilian, White puts his Knight on c3. White may yet play d4, but for the moment the question is yet to be answered. White's second move suggests the possibility of NOT playing d4 (avoiding the exchange), and playing a closed position instead of the slashing, attacking types of position, that are more common to the Sicilian Defence. Leads to 
3.g3 g6 4.Bg2 Bg7 5.d3 d6
</p><p>...e6 Sicilian Defence, Closed Variation
</p><p>This leads to g6, d5.
</p><p>...e5 Severino Defence
</p><p>This defence is not recommended for Black. Allowing White's f1-Bishop unobstructed view of the f7-square is not safe in Sicilian formations. Also, 2...e5 creates a hole in Black's pawn structure at d5: The chance of Black being allowed to play ...d5 is remote.
