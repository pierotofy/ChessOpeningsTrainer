<h3><span id="3._g3">3. g3</span></h3>
<p>A rarely seen and somewhat illogical move, because the light squared bishop can already develop easily. White can fianchetto the bishop, but it is not always ideally placed here, and if he moves it along the f1-a6 diagonal, then the g2 and h3 squares easily become weak due to the compromised pawn structure.
