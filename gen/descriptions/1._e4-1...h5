<h3><span id="1...h5">1...h5</span></h3>
<p>This defense is considered a very weak response to the King's Pawn Opening, and is usually considered even worse than the Corn Stalk Defense, as not only does it not open any lines for development and allow White quick and easy development, it additionally weakens Black's king position slightly. Note the development of the rook to h6 can easily be prevented by 2. d4.
