<p>Here black enters the From Gambit. White's choices are either taking the pawn, or moving to e4, entering the King's Gambit. The From's main line is with 2.fxe5 d6 3.exd6 Bxd6, usually followed by a vicious kingside assault with g5, or a more strategical Nc6.
</p><p>White can also decline the second pawn with the line 1.f4 e5 2.fxe5 d6 3.Nf3 dxe5 4.e4, where White's missing f-pawn can be a king safety issue, or an attacking asset after he castles due to the open f-file. The trade of the f-pawn for the d-pawn can also give white additional center control.
