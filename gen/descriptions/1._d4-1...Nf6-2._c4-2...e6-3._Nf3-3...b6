<p>The Queen's Indian Defence is a popular and fairly modern opening whereby black quickly develops his queenside bishop, either by fianchettoing it on b7 to contest the long diagonal, or on a6 to put pressure on white's c-pawn.
</p><p>It has been employed regularly by a number of top players including former world champions like  Anatoly Karpov and Viswanathan Anand.
