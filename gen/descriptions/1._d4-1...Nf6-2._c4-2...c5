<p>Black threatens to exchange the c pawn against a central pawn. The objectively best solution for White is to advance the pawn and play 3. d5, gaining space in the center. To avoid this, White may play 3. Nf3, protecting the pawn. This move allows Black to exchange the pawns or to increase pressure by playing 3...e6. Additionally, 3.Nf3 may transpose to a Maroczy Bind Sicilian. The last option is 3. e3 but this leads to a blocked game for white (both bishops are blocked by pawns and Black will get a lead in development). Notice that if white takes with 3. dxc5 Black will not lose material. With the moves 3...Na6 or 3...e6, Black will equalize easily.
