<p>When played seriously this defence is workable. Black lets White grab the center like in a "hypermodern" opening, while gaining power on the queenside. Usually, b5 and Bb7 will follow soon (attacking e4 pawn, eventually with help of Nf6). That way, Black can enter a very playable middlegame, contrary to what might have been expected. It remains viable in highly skilled games, such as Tony Miles overcoming Karpov using this opening.</p><p>In response to this move, White can either start taking control of the center with 2. d4 or try to prevent the b5 move with 2. c4. But this last move is considered inferior because of 2...e5, where Black would have a slight advantage (the same goes for 2. a4).
</p><p>Also note that White can try to set a powerful trap for unadvised Black players (but those who play the St. George as Black are generally advised players) by playing 2. Bc4. If 2...b5, then 3. Bxf7+ Kxf7 4. Qh5+ and White can manage to win a rook.
</p><p>White can also choose to develop a Knight first with 2. Nf3 or to challenge Black on the diagonal with 2. g3.
