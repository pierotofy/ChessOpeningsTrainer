<p>A common line of the Scotch Game, Bc5 attacks the d4 knight and puts indirect pressure on the f2 square if the knight moves.
</p><p>White's standard response is to support the d4 knight with 5. Be3, which threatens to immediately win a piece with Nxc6, dxc6(...Bxe3; Nxd8 wins the black queen); Bxc5. Another role of White's bishop on e3 is to protect the weak f2 pawn.  Play will often continue 5...Qf6 6. c3, and is thought to be equal for black.
</p><p>If 5. c3 Qf6 6. Nxc6??, Black can checkmate by 6...Qxf2#.
</p><p>Other playable moves all involve avoiding the committing of attackers and defenders against the d4 knight. These moves include 5. Nxc6, 5. Nf5 and 5. Nb3.
