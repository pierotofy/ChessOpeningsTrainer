<p>Towards this move black has basically two typical set ups.
</p>
<ul><li>One is a fortress like position with pawn structure f5-e6-d5. This is called the Stonewall defence. This type of position is considered solid, but perhaps too static.</li>
<li>A dynamic choice is a Leningrad setup. The pawn structure is practically always g6-f5-d6. Black plays in this system, with only a few rare exceptions, his bishop to g7, knight to f6, and castles quickly.</li></ul>
