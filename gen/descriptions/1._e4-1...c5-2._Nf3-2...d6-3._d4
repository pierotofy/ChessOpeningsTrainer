<p>The aggressive advance of White's d-pawn forms a classical centre (pawns on e4 and d4), a strong formation which threatens to gain a large space advantage by a subsequent d5 or e5. Black is therefore compelled to break up White's centre. 
</p><p>In the Sicilian, this is easily achieved with the exchange 3...cxd4, the control of d4 being the major reason the c-pawn was moved to c5 originally. With this natural move Black acquires a majority of central pawns and half-opens the c-file. 
</p><p>His other means of attacking the centre pawns is with 3...Nf6, in an attempt to avoid the Mar√≥czy Bind by tempting the b1 knight out, but White can simply take the c-pawn with quicker development. 
</p><p>3...Nc6 invites either d5 or dxc5 with a strong initiative.
