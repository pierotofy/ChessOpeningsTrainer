<h3><span id="3.Nc3">3.Nc3</span></h3>
<p>After building a pawn center with his first two moves, White begins the development of his minor pieces with 3.Nc3. On c3, the knight controls the d5 and e4 squares. White would like to play e4 at some point to gain even more presence in the center, and 3.Nc3 facilitates this break.
</p><p>White's dark-squared bishop will likely go to g5 after Black plays Nf6.
