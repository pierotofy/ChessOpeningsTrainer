<h1><span id="Catalan_Opening">Catalan Opening</span></h1>
<p>This is the <b>Catalan Opening</b>, named after the Spanish region of Catalonia, when Grandmaster Savielly Tartakower was asked, at the Barcelona tournament of 1929, to invent an opening system in honor of the region's chess history. Usually, the game continues <b>3...d5 4.Nf3</b>. The Catalan then has two main branches, the Open Variation and the Closed Variation. In the Open Variation, Black takes the pawn on c4. This gives White strong pressure on Black's queenside, thanks to the fianchettoed bishop on g2. In the Closed Variation, Black retains his strong-point on d5, attempting to block out the bishop on g2, but stays passive.
