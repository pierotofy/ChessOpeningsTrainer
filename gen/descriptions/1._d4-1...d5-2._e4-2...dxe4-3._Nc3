<h3><span id="3._Nc3">3. Nc3</span></h3>
<p>White has brought his minor piece into action and taken control of the middle. Simultaneously, he has put pressure on Black's e4-pawn, which Black must now try and defend. Nf6 or Bf5 would most commonly be used to defend the lone pawn, while e5 gives the option of a pawn transfer.
