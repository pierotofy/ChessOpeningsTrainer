<h3><span id="5._f4">5. f4</span></h3>
<p>The <b>Four Pawns Attack</b> is the most aggressive line for white in the King's Indian. White creates a massive pawn centre and has full control over the middle of the board ... for now. This is a dangerous line for black, and if the second player doesn't play correctly he will be knocked off the board by white's advancing army! However, if black can survive the initial onslaught, he will have the better game since white will have many weak squares in his camp that his pawns can't defend. For this reason, the Four Pawns Attack isn't seen frequently at the highest levels of chess, although it's still very viable at the amateur level.
