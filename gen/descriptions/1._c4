<p>This opening is very flexible. It can transpose into many others.

<h3><span id="Black.27s_responses"></span><span id="Black's_responses">Black's responses</span></h3>
<ul><li>1...e5 is a "reversed" Sicilian Defence.</li>
<li>1...e6 will probably end up in a Queen's Gambit Declined. This is known as the Agincourt Defense. However, if White plays 2. d4 then Black plays 2... Nf6, it is a typical Indian game (1. d4 nf6 2. c4 e6 is the normal order)</li>
<li>1...c6 will usually either transpose into the Caro-Kann Defence or the Slav Defence.</li>
<li>1...Nf6 or 1...g6 are likely to transpose into an Indian Defence.</li>
<li>1...b6 will in all likelihood transpose into the English Defence.</li>
<li>1...f5, the Anglo-Dutch Defence, leads to sharp tactical lines for Black, but can open a powerful kingside attack. This is likely to transpose into the regular Dutch Defense after 2. d4.</li>
<li>1...d5 is seldom played but may transpose into the Queen's Gambit or the RÃ©ti Opening.</li>
<li>1...g5, the Myers Defence, gives White a small advantage.</li>
<li>1...b5 normally gives good chances for Black, even though the Halibut Gambit is considered unsound at the professional level.</li></ul><p>Most "pure" English lines come from the Symmetrical Variation (1...c5) and are quite hard to play and to understand.
