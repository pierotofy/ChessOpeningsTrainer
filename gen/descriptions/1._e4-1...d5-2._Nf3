<h1><span id="2._Nf3_-_Tennison_Gambit">2. Nf3 - Tennison Gambit</span></h1>
<p>White sacrifices a pawn in the hopes of a potential lead in development. Black will generally make the move 2...dxe4, accepting the gambit, or 2...Nf6, attacking White's pawn and defending Black's d5 pawn.
</p><p>White may respond with 3. Ng5 after 2...dxe4 to try to complete the jokingly named Tennison Gambit Intercontinental Ballistic Missile Variant, which gives White a serious lead in development.
