<h2><span id="1..._f5_-_Dutch_Defence">1... f5 - Dutch Defence</span></h2>
<p>The Dutch Defence has a character all of its own. Black usually plays either for a Classical setup with 2... e6 3... d6 4... Be7, a Stonewall with 2... e6 3... d5 4... c6, or for the Leningrad with 2... g6 3... Bg7 4... d6. White usually plays 2. c4 here, though many moves are playable. One interesting, though often considered dubious, option is to play the Staunton Gambit with 2. e4 leading to more tactical positions rather than the positional grinds and straightforward attacks the Dutch usually provides. This grabs the e4-square without copying moves.
