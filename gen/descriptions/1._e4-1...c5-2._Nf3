<h3><span id="2._Nf3">2. Nf3</span></h3>
<p>White's move <b>2. Nf3</b> increased her control of the d4 square, enabling her to play d4 next move. Black cannot hope to resist White's plan any further, and should go about his own development. 
</p><p>2...d6 is the main line move, controlling e5 for a potential advance of the e-pawn and letting the queen's bishop out, while also holding down the c-pawn in case White should go down a different path. 
</p><p>2...e6 is an older move freeing the king's bishop although d6 will often follow soon. 
</p><p>2...Nc6 reserves options in the centre and keeps an eye on d4, as does 2...g6 planning Bg7, and 2...a6 can restrain some of White's longer-term plans and provide the springboard for a b5 advance, though it neglects the centre. 
</p><p>There are many slightly different Sicilians with similar plans for Black, in which various combinations of these moves may turn up in almost any order.
</p><p>The one significant departure from the main lines is 2...Nf6, evoking Alekhine's Defence by attacking the e-pawn to tempt it forward.
