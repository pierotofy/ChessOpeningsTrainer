<p>White is once again threatening to win Blacks e-pawn, although Black is temporarily a pawn up anyway. More importantly, Black needs to complete her development and if possible reinforce the crusading knight on e4, but the immediate ...d5 would leave the c6-knight pinned allowing the powerful Nxe5. 6...Be7 is a semi-useful move, but to really get to grips with the situation Black should play 6...b5 preparing ...d5 by chasing the bishop away.
</p><p>Black can also accept White's gambit with 6...exd4, which leads to a wonderful mess.
