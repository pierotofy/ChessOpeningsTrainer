<h1><span id="Torre_Attack">Torre Attack</span></h1>
<p>The Torre Attack is not often seen at top level, as statistically doesn't give white much more than equality. However, if black does not play accurately, white can get a dangerous kingside attack.
</p><p>e6 is most common, although statistically gives white the better chances, and plays into whites goals for the Torre. Perhaps best for black is the dynamic c5.
