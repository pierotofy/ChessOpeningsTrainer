This opening was recommended by Joseph Truelson (called the anti-e4 RAR attack by him) in his RAR group. Joseph explains:</p><blockquote><p>Of course, simply saying RAR isn't going to rake in every game as a victory. In some games, you need an opening that is very evil, and will confuse the opponent and force him into passivity while being scared, even though he is playing white! That is why I saved chess by creating the RAR attack vs. e4. There are many RAR attacks, but only one that is against e4. without even considering your opponent's reply, play 1...d6 and 2...f5. This may seem dumb but you are RARing his center, getting rid of your pawns, and being very risky, by opening up your king. Opening up your king is bad, but your opponent will think that you have studied it and deemed it sound, so he will play passively. No more of White taking the initiative! Unless you are playing an engine (which we do all the time), play the the Anti-e4 RAR attack!</p></blockquote>
<p>This could also transpose from the Staunton Gambit (1. d4 f5 2. e4), also known as the Balogh Defense. This happens when the Staunton Gambit of the Dutch Defense is Declined. However, it is generally said to be stronger to accept the Staunton Gambit, so this opening rarely happens.
