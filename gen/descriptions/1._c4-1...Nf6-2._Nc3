<p>White reinforces the attack on the d5 square and keeps his options open. Black has a variety of answers here, aiming for a King's Indian setup with 2...g6 is an interesting option, 2...e6 is also possible although white can choose to disrupt black's plan of reaching a Nimzo-Indian or QID setup by playing 3. e4 leading to the very sharp and tactical variations known collectively as the Mikenas Carls variation, which black is best advised to avoid if not prepared to face them.
</p><p>2...e5 is also possible leading to the English four knights and the Bremen system
