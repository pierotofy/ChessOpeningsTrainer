<p>6.Bxc6!? is an interesting move. It may look like a waste of time. The main line goes 6.- dxc6 7.Qe1! and black has a couple of problems here:
1.7.- Bd6?! leads to 8.d4! and if exd4?, 9.e5!. If black plays 8.- Qe7, white plays 9.dxe5! which leads to: 9.- Bxe5 10.Nxe5 Qxe5 11.Qc3 Ng4 12.Qxe5+ Nxe5 13.f4! Ng6 14.f5!(14.Be3 is also good) Ne5 15.Bf4 and white stands much better because of his better pawn structure.
2.7.- f6 is impossible because there is a knight on f6.
The best move is probably 7.- Qd6.
