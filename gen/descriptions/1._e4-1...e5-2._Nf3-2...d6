<p>The Black fortress is solid. White should not wait before attacking it, because Black can play 3...f5 if White plays a passive move, which would definitely equalize.
</p><p>The best move is probably 3. d4. White threatens a queen exchange with dxe5 dxe5 Qxd8+ Kxd8 and Black can forget about castling. It puts pressure on the center and the Black fortress may collapse at any time.
</p><p>Another possibility is 3. Bc4 leading to a more positional game, playable for both camps.
