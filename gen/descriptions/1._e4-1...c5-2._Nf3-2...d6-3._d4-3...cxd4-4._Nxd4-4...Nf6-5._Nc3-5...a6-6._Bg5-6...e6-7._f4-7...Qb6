</p><p>Black launches a direct attack on the b2 pawn. White should defend it with 8. Nb3 or leave it to the enemy with 8. Qd2. This variation gained notoriety in the 1960s with Fischer's espousal of the system. His idea was that after grabbing a pawn, he could use his almost flawless technique to neutralize White's dangerous lead in development, and then win with his extra pawn and bishop pair.
