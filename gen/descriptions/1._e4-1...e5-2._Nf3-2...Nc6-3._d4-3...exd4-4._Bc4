<h1><span id="Scotch_Gambit">Scotch Gambit</span></h1>
<p>Black can continue the Scotch with 4...Bc5 5.c3 and now 5...Nf6 will transpose into a safe variation of the Giuoco Piano. Alternatively, he can transpose into the Two Knights Defense with 4...Nf6 and White has now two sound options: the obvious 5. e5 and 5. O-O. In the first case 5. e5 white goes for maintaining a strong center and an open game with chances for both sides. 5. O-O gives away the pawn, and while taking it might seem risky due to 6.. Re1 it's perfectly sound, and white will only get his pawn back.
</p><p>Black can instead accept the gambit with 5...dxc3 but this is riskier because White will gain a lead in development. A possible continuation is 6.Nxc3 (Grandmaster Sveshnikov has played 6.Bxf7+!? Kxf7 7.Qd5+ followed by 8.Qxc5 recommended in Chess Openings for White, explained) 6...d6 7.Qb3 Qd7 8.Nd5 Nge7 9.Qc3 0-0.<i>GÃ¶ring Gambit'</i>. This gambit is quite similar to the Danish Gambit.
