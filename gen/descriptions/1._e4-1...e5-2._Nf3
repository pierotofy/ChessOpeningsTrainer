<h2><span id="2._Nf3_-_Open_Game">2. Nf3 - Open Game</span></h2>
<p>Black's valuable center pawn is threatened with capture, but White's pawn remains safe. 
</p><p>The question for Black at this point is whether to challenge the White pawn on e4 or support the Black one on e5.
</p>
<h3><span id="Supporting_the_Black_pawn">Supporting the Black pawn</span></h3>
<p><b>2... Nc6</b> is the natural move, combining defence of the pawn with control of the d4 square and avoiding committing another pawn for now. 
</p><p>2. Nf3 is 10 times more popular than everything else combined, and in turn the reply 2... Nc6 is about 5 times more popular than everything else combined.
</p>
<p><b>2... d6</b><b>,</b> Philidor's Defence, is the other safe option to defend the pawn. 
</p><p>It restricts the f8 bishop to the e7 square, and grants White an advantage in territory, but it builds a fortress that cannot be easily battered down. 
</p><p>An alternative (older) way to play this is to follow up with 3... f5.
</p>
<p>Note that <b>2... f6?</b> is a bad move. 
</p><p>It has a name, Damiano's Defence, but poor Damiano never wanted his name associated with it because it doesn't work – White captures the pawn anyway.
</p>
<h3><span id="Challenging_the_White_pawn">Challenging the White pawn</span></h3>
<p><b>2... Nf6</b> is the Petrov Defence. 
</p><p>Black wants the same things that White wants, but once again White will be back in a symmetrical position with the advantage of moving first.
</p>
<p><b>2... f5</b> is the Latvian Gambit. 
</p><p>This iconic counter-thrust divides opinion like very few other openings. 
</p><p>Has Black lured White into a minefield of tricks and traps leading to an inevitable violent death? 
</p><p>Or has Black given away a pawn for nothing?
</p>
<p><b>2... d5</b> is the Elephant Gambit. 
</p><p>It's along the same lines as the Latvian, but less complex – White needs to do less memorising to reach a good position.
